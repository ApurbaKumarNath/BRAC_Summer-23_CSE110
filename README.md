# All my learnings of Basic Python & OOP that won't dissapoint

I started learning to code using python, and I have taken comprehensive notes on all the conpects that I have learned till now.

These notes have all the fundamental concepts noted down in a beginner-friendly way and I believe these would surely help anybody to achieve a good understanding of the basics. You will find in-depth coverage of every concept including comments for explanation. You will also find my **University assignment problems and their solutions** for practicing.
