# All my learnings that won't dissapoint

I started learning to code using python, and I have taken comprehensive notes on all the conpects that I have learned till now.

**Why is this worth checking out? => Any learner will benefit from this.**

These notes have all the fundamental concepts noted down in a beginner-friendly way and I believe these would surely help anybody to achieve a good understanding of the basics. 
You will find in-depth coverage of every concept including comments for explanation.
You will also find my University assignment problems and their solutions for practicing.
