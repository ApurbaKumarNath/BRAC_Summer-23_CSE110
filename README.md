# All my learnings that won't dissapoint

I started learning to code using python, and I have taken comprehensive Python notes.

**Why is this worth checking out? => Any learner will benefit from this.**
The best thing is that these notes have all the fundamentals and concepts noted down in a beginner-friendly way. 
You will find in-depth coverage of every concept including comments for explanation and step-by-step breakdowns of code execution.
I have mainly focused on taking notes of concepts, so you won't find projects or problem-solving here.
